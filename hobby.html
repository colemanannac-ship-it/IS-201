    <h4 class="boxed">Passion of Anna Coleman</h4>

    <p>My passion is running. I have been running for about 13 years. I competed in Cross Country for seven years, and Track and Field for four years.</p>
    <p>My dad has been running for many years and has been my biggest inspiration. He has always encouraged me to keep on going, even when things got hard.</p>
    <p>I have never trained or ran to be the fastest I could be. I run because of the peace and clarity it gives me.</p>
    <p>Running makes me feel good in my mind and body. I do not need to do it to get a certain pace down, I just need to do it where I can love it.</p><br>
